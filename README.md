# final-project-bbms

This project is a minigame, where the objective is to turn off all 4 lights before the timer runs out. 


The timer starts when the first light is turned off, and if it reaches 35 seconds, all the lights turn back on.


The **W** and **S** key are used to move along the z axis, while the **A** and **D** keys are use to move along the x axis. 


The **E** key can be used to turn off a light if the character is close enough to it.
